# Phase 2 Project Description

The Project is about houses in north westerncounty. That were built forthe purpose  of selling.

## Project Overview

For this project, I have used simple and multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### Business Problem
The business problem of the house owners is to make predictions on the prices of the houses based on the given parameters. A Data scientist is obliged to Used the parameters to predict price.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this assignment's GitHub repository. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

It is up to you to decide what data from this dataset to use and how to use it. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind, we recommend you **ignore** some or all of the following features:

* `date`
* `view`
* `sqft_above`
* `sqft_basement`
* `yr_renovated`
* `zipcode`
* `lat`
* `long`
* `sqft_living15`
* `sqft_lot15`

FINDINGS
 improving a home's condition from Average to Very Good increases sale price by 42,180 dollars​

improving a home's grade from Better to High Quality increases sale price by 72,690 dollars​

addition of a basement to a home increases sale price by 40,450 dollars​

 increasing the sqft_living of a home increases sale price by 63.75 dollars​

having a waterfront in a home increases sale price by 10,740 dollars​

RECOMMENDATIONS

Home owners should renovate their homes by increasing the sqft_living since an increase per inch raises the value by 63.75 dollars. Lets assume theres a 1000 inch increase, theres an estimated increase in value by 63,750 dollars.​

Home owners should also increase the number of bedroms,have a basement,have a waterfront, improve condition to very good,add additional floors and improve the grade to high quality in order to maximise value of their homes before listing.​
